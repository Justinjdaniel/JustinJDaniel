My name is **Justin J Daniel**. I am a versatile developer passionate about Full Stack Development, Blockchain, and Data Analytics, with a strong commitment to Open Source technologies. A lifelong learner, I actively seek opportunities to apply my diverse skill set to create impactful solutions and contribute positively to the community.

## 🚀 What I'm Currently Working On:

- 🔭 Building decentralized applications (dApps) with Blockchain and Web3 technologies.
- 🌱 Enhancing my skills in Smart Contract Development and Full Stack Development.
- 📊 Actively learning Data Analytics principles and tools (e.g., Python data stack, visualization tools) to derive insights from data.
- ✍️ Publishing articles on my [personal website](https://justinjdaniel.com) and Dev.to, sharing insights on Full Stack Development, Web3, and my ongoing journey into Data Analytics.
- 🛠️ Refining my understanding of GraphQL and API Management, particularly in:
  - Query optimization and performance
  - Robust schema design
- 🔗 Exploring Blockchain Network Management concepts:
  - Node operations and consensus
  - Network security and scalability solutions
- 🎯 Continuing to explore the Go programming language for backend development.
- 🔍 Researching and experimenting with various DeFi protocols and their applications.
- 👥 Open to collaborating on impactful projects in Web3, Full Stack, or Data Analytics.

## 🎯 Future Aspirations:

- 📝 Author and publish a monthly technical article on my Dev.to blog, covering topics across Web3, GraphQL, and Data Analytics.
- 🤝 Become an active contributor to a specific open-source project in the DeFi, Blockchain infrastructure, or Data Science space.
- 🚀 Develop and launch at least two personal projects this year that leverage my skills in Solidity, Next.js, GraphQL, or incorporate significant Data Analytics components.
- 📊 Apply Data Analytics methodologies to extract actionable insights and enhance decision-making within my Full Stack and Web3 projects.
- 🔗 Pioneer projects at the intersection of Blockchain and Data Analytics, such as on-chain data analysis or developing predictive models for digital assets.
- 🎤 Attend and network at 2-3 major Web3 or Data Science conferences (virtual or in-person) and present a lightning talk at a relevant developer meetup.
- 📚 Create a series of short video tutorials on smart contract security best practices or introductory Data Analytics concepts.

### 🌱 Continuous Learning:

- 💡 Mastering advanced features of the Go programming language for high-performance backend and blockchain applications.
- 🛡️ Deep diving into advanced Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof concepts and their practical applications in enhancing privacy and scalability in Web3.
- 📈 Achieve proficiency in data visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI to effectively communicate data-driven insights.
- 🧠 Complete a comprehensive specialization in Machine Learning, focusing on predictive analytics and model deployment.
- 📜 Completing the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) certification to enhance my DevOps capabilities for decentralized infrastructure.
